      <img src="assets/images/headshot.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Carolyn Moneymaker">

      <p>I am an operations professional with varied project management experience, most recently in the apparel and fashion industry. Currently I am attending a software development boot camp at University of Denver in anticipation of a career switch to the tech industry.</p>
      
      <p>Professionally, I demonstrate strong communication and organization skills, heightened attention to detail, proficiency in systems creation and optimization, a proactive mindset, and clear aptitude for delivering on responsibilities. I am a driven team leader and highly motivated team member.</p>
      
      <P>I live in the Platt Park neighborhood of Denver, CO. In my free time I enjoy taking walks, brunching with friends, catching up on my favorite TV shows, and hiking with Corey (my husband) and Walter (my Australian Cattle Dog).</P>
